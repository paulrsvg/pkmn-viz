Welcome to Glitch
=================

So I wanted to work on making some simple examples with different kinds of d3 charts. 

but dummy data is no fun. 
I wanted to make it fun by finding a bit of real data from somewhere on the interwebs.
So I found a survey on gen 1 pokemon starters!

"Japan’s MyNavi recently conducted a survey of 400 college students (197 boys, 203 girls)..."
 https://soranews24.com/2016/03/15/i-choose-you-survey-reveals-most-popular-starter-pokemon-among-japanese-college-students/

Alright here's the responses to the question of: who was your original starter?

Pokemon | Charmander       | Squirtle          | Bulbasaur |
----| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
Number(out of 400)| 157      | 130| 113 |
Percentage | 39.3%     | 32.5%      |   28.2% |


###pkmn nostalgia


Pokemon was a mad epic game when I was younger. I never owned a gameboy growing up with my parents but I would play games by borrowing them from friends. A little later I got a palm pilot and ran an emulator on it (liberty for those interested or familiar with palm software http://www.gambitstudios.com/liberty.asp). 

I still enjoy playing the original pokemon games as well as fan made hacks on occasion.
